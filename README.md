I used this API to generate a random image of New York City, as we did a weather app based in new york.  Only issue I had was the image was not generating properly, but that was due to the fact that I didn't display the imagedata in the code properly.
# News API
This API gets some recent headlines based on some parameters. I could have gone with everything, but I decided to cater it to the current audience, so it displays Science News for the US.

anything that might get us in trouble.
